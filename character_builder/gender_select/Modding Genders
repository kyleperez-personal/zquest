For whatever reason, you may want to add extra genders.
I suppress my own beliefs on this.

To do this, you have to open:
	gender_select.cpp
	gender_select_functions.cpp
	gender_select_functions.h
	
(NOTE: THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE IS FOR A TRINARY SYSTEM; it can certainly be made significantly more complex if you so choose, for example, making the boolean values non-exclusive, etc)
	
In gender_select.cpp modify the following:
	Under the Output section (line 11), add more boolean values that tell information about the player gender
		-note, this is not absolutely necessary, but a shorthand for future checks down the line.
		
	EX:
		bool player_is_gender1;
		bool player_is_gender2;
		bool player_is_gender3;
		...
		
	You will have to modify the gender_pick() function to have more arguments
		EX (AT LINE 26)
			gender_pick(player_gender, player_is_gender1, player_is_gender_2, player_is_gender3);
			
			
	
In gender_select_functions.cpp modify the following function:

1. gender_pick()
	This function was explicitly built with a binary choice in mind.
	
	You will have to modify the gender_pick() function to accept more boolean arguments that are passed BY REFERENCE into the function.
		EX (AT LINE 21 to 25)
			void gender_pick(
				string& player_gender,
				bool& player_is_gender1,
				bool& player_is_gender2,
				bool& player_is_gender3
				...
			) {
	
	You may want to print a list of the availible genders you declare, which prints out as so:
		(AT LINE 30)
		cout << "Pick one of the following genders:" << endl;
		cout << "Gender 1" << endl;
		cout << "Gender 2" << endl;
		cout << "Gender 3" << endl;
		...
	
	For the checking of player genders, you will need to add more else if statements to check for the correct input
		(AT LINES 36 to 49)
		if (player_gender == "Gender 1") {
		
			player_is_gender1 = true;
			player_is_gender2 = false;
			player_is_gender3 = false;
			return;
		
		}
		else if (player_gender == "Gender 2") {
		
			player_is_gender1 = false;
			player_is_gender2 = true;
			player_is_gender3 = false;
			return;
			
		}
		else if (player_gender == "Gender 3") {
		
			player_is_gender1 = false;
			player_is_gender2 = false;
			player_is_gender3 = true;
			return;
			
		}
		...
		
		
		
		
In gender_select_functions.h modify the following:
	Make the gender_pick function compatible with all your arguments
	EX: (LINE 8 to 12)
		void gender_pick(
			string& player_gender,
			bool& player_is_gender1,
			bool& player_is_gender2,
			bool& player_is_gender3
			...
		);
	
	
NOTE: you will have to modify the source code to add dialogue/information related to your added genders in the campaign itself.
