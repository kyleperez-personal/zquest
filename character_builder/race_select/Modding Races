For your own purposes, you may want to add your own races (or remove some).

To do this, you have to open:
	race_select_functions.cpp
	
In race_select_functions.cpp modify the following functions:

1. race_list()
	See inline example in source code.
	
	To add more races, add to cout list, following examples
	To remove, remove from cout list
		--To make hidden races, remove races from this list

2. race_info()
	See inline example in source code
	
	To add races, add else-if statement with race name. Add a description
	To remove, remove else-if statements
		--To make hidden races, add else-if statement with race, but don't include
		it in race_list()

3. race_selection()
	See inline example in source code
	
	To add races, add else-if statement with race name; copy code from other race
	To remove races, remove else-if statements

4. race_confirm()
	Inline code example of poor quality
	
	Add if/else-if statements to the initial block of code: (unmodded lines 585-606) that
	hold the different cout lines.
	Add your proper descriptor:
		EXAMPLE: adding the 'Black" race
			cout << "You are Black" << endl;
			
		--The else statement should cover a significant portion of races that don't start
		with vowels
	To remove races, just remove the relevant if/else-if statements to save on computation time.
	
	
NOTE: you will have to modify the source code to add dialogue/information related to your added races in the campaign itself.
